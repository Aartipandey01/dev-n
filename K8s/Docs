# Kubernetes: Understanding Communities and Software Development

 To understand Kubernetes, we first need to understand how software development works. Why do we need communities in software development?
 This is an important question, but before we dive into that, we have to understand Docker because it's a prerequisite for Kubernetes.
 Let me know in the chat if you have any questions or if you are not familiar with Docker or Kubernetes so I can adjust my teaching accordingly.
 
## What is Docker?

Docker is a container-based software technology used in DevOps. It's important to note that Docker is not exactly like Kubernetes.
They are different but related technologies.

## Why Do We Need Communities in Software Development?

Communities are used extensively in DevOps, especially in software development where profits need to be made.
Kubernetes is commonly used for deployment, which is where the software goes to the end-users, customers or testers.
The tester takes this code and tests it for various things such as requirement testing and build process testing. 
The aim is to ensure that the code goes to the user without any issues.


## The Importance of Community

In software development, communities are often used for a specific purpose. Communities help to ensure that the code goes out to the users without any issues.
They also help to create a sense of empathy and understanding within teams, which can go a long way in making the development process smoother and more efficient.

## Understanding Containerization and Docker

If you're looking to understand Docker, you need to understand containerization first.
Essentially, containerization solves compatibility issues that can arise from different devices being involved in software development and delivery.
The developer might test their code on one laptop with certain tools, while the tester uses another, and the production environment is on a server.
Making sure the code behaves the same way in all of these environments can be tedious and difficult.
