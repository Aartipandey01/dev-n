~~ Elastic compute cloud

I want to launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance from a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

Resolution
To launch a new EC2 instance from an AMI, do the following:

Open the EC2 console.
Note: Be sure to select the AWS Region that you want to launch the instance in.

From the navigation bar, choose AMIs.
Find the AMI that you want to use to launch a new instance. To begin, open the menu next to the search bar, and then choose one of the following:
If the AMI that you’re using is one that you created, select Owned by me.
If the AMI that you’re using is a public AMI, select Public images.
If the AMI that you’re using is a private image that someone else shared with you, select Private images.
Note: The search bar automatically provides filtering options as well as automatically matching AMI IDs.

Select the AMI, and then choose Launch.
Choose an instance type, and then choose Next: Configure Instance Details. Optionally select configuration details, such as associating an IAM role with the instance.
Select Next: Add Storage. You can use the default root volume type, or select a new type from the Volume Type dropdown list. Select Add New Volume if you want to add additional storage to your instance.

Select Next: Add Tags. You can add custom tags to your instance to help you categorize your resources.
Select Next: Configure Security Group. You can associate a security group with your instance to allow or block traffic to the instance.
Select Review and Launch. Review the instance details.
Select Previous to return to a previous screen to make changes. Select Launch when you are ready to launch the instance.
